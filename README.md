# SFDC Brewery Salesforce Developer Agent üçªü§ñ

Welcome to the **SFDC Brewery Salesforce Developer Agent**! This project leverages **Microsoft Autogen** to create a conversational AI agent that generates and executes Salesforce code based on user input or Jira tasks. Whether you're a Salesforce developer or administrator, this tool will help you automate repetitive tasks and boost productivity.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Describe your task in plain English, and the agent will generate and execute the required Salesforce code.
- **Jira Integration**: Automatically parse Jira tasks and generate code to implement them.
- **Code Execution**: Execute Salesforce code directly from the interface.
- **Modern UI**: Built with Streamlit for a clean and interactive user experience.
